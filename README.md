# Word-Puzzle-Game
The creation of a C++ word puzzle game is the main goal of this project. Finding words inside a grid of characters is the object of the game. The main goal is to improve vocabulary and pattern recognition abilities while offering a fun game environment.

The game's game board, where characters are randomly positioned, is represented by a 2-dimensional array. Through a command-line interface, the player communicates with the game. Because the board is originally filled by reading from a file, customization, and variation are possible.

There are three different difficulty settings in the game: easy, intermediate, and severe. Each level increases the difficulty by enlarging the search area and adding harder patterns to find. On the console, the player's score and remaining lives are shown at all times.

The project also has features like displaying high scores and preserving game progress. The player can pause the game and pick it back up later by saving the current state to a file. The top five players are kept track of by keeping track of high scores and sorting them in ascending order.

Overall, this project offers players a fun and instructive word puzzle game that pushes them to expand their vocabulary. The implementation shows how to use a number of programming topics, such as handling files, multidimensional arrays, manipulating strings, and algorithmic problem-solving methods.
